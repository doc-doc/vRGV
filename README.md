# Visual Relation Grounding in Videos

This is the pytorch implementation of our work at ECCV2020 (Spotlight). 
![teaser](https://github.com/doc-doc/vRGV/blob/master/introduction.png)
The repository mainly includes 3 parts: (1) Extract RoI feature; (2) Train and inference; and (3) Generate relation-aware trajectories.

## Environment

Anaconda 3, python 3.6.5, pytorch 0.4.1 (Higher version is OK once feature is ready) and cuda >= 9.0. For others libs, please refer to the file requirements.txt.

## Install
Please create an env for this project using anaconda3 (should install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) first)
```
>conda create -n envname python=3.6.5 # Create
>conda activate envname # Enter
>pip install -r requirements.txt # Install the provided libs
>sh vRGV/lib/make.sh # Set the environment for detection, make sure you have nvcc
```
## Data Preparation
Please download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNJ3jBPPoi0BPkvLqooS66czvCxsib1M/view?usp=sharing). The folder ```ground_data``` should be at the same directory as ```vRGV```. Please merge the downloaded vRGV folder with this repo. 

Please download the extracted videos [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HpgJ38GjW0mXXBjsEMReLvXhfYaehKqR/view?usp=sharing), and put them into ground_data. 
The directory should be like: ground_data/vidvrd/JPEGImages/ILSVRC2015_train_xxx/000000.JPEG.

## Usage
Feature Extraction. (need about 100G storage! Because I dumped all the detected bboxes along with their features. It can be greatly reduced by changing detect_frame.py to return the top-40 bboxes and save them with .npz file.)
```
./detection.sh 0 val #(or train)
```
Sample video features:
```
cd tools
python sample_video_feature.py
```
Test. You can use our provided model to verify the feature and environment:
```
./ground.sh 0 val # Output the relation-aware spatio-temporal attention
python generate_track_link.py # Generate relation-aware trajectories with Viterbi algorithm.
python eval_ground.py # Evaluate the performance
```
You will get accuracy:
|Acc_s| Acc_o | Acc_R|
|36.77| 36.30 | 24.58 |
Train. If you want to train the model from stratch. Please apply a two-stage training scheme: 1) train a basic model without relation attendance, and 2) load the recostruction part of the pre-trained model to learn the whole model (with the same lr_rate). For implementation, please turn off/on [pretrain] in line 53 of ```ground.py```, and switch between line 6 & 7 in ```ground_relation.py```  for 1st & 2nd stage training respectively. Also, you need to change the model files in line 69 & 70 to the best model obtained at the first stage for 2nd-stage training. 
```
./ground.sh 0 train # Train the model with GPU id 0
```
You will get the results with Acc_R around 24.58. For comparison, please follow the results reported in our paper.
